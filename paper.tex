\section{Abstract}

	\begin{frame}{Abstract}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {
		A binary voxel grid can be represented more efficiently by using a Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG) than Sparse Voxel Octree(SVO)
		}
		\item {
			Along with efficient encoding of empty regions , DAG allows efficient encoding of identical regions as nodes are allowed to share pointers
		}
		\item {
			This paper presents a bottom-up algorithm to reduce a SVO to DAG
		}
		\item {
			The memory consumption of DAG is significantly smaller and it would fit in memory where SVO won't
		}
		\item {
			DAG requires no decompression and can be traversed easily
		}
		\item {
			This paper demonstrates this by ray tracing hard and soft shadows , ambient occlusion , and primary rays in extremly high resolution DAG at speed at par or even faster than voxel and triangle GPU ray tracing.
		}

\section{Introduction}

% You can reveal the parts of a slide one at a time
% with the \pause command:
\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    There is increased interest in evaluating secondary rays for effects as reflection, shadows and indirect illumination. Due to the incoherence, a scondary scene representation is required with strict memory budget
    
  }
  \item {   
    This acceleration structure has to be resident on RAM for effiecient access.
  }
  \item{
  However this is problematic when triangle meshes are augmented with displacement maps as they become infeasibly large to millions of polygons
  \pause
  }
  \item {
  	Recently Sparse Voxel Octree(SVO) has been used as a secondary scene representation, since they provide implicit LOD mechanism and can be efficiently ray traced in real time.
  }
  \item {
  	At high resolution, SVO is still too much memory expensive, therefore it's application has been limited }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
  		The data structure \textbf{DAG} allows for extremly high resolution enabling us to improve image quality, decrease discretization artifacts, explore high frequency effects like sharp shadows in large scenes.
    }
 
  \end{itemize}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.36]{fig1}{C Figure 1: The EPIC CITADEL scene voxelized to a $128K^3$ resolution and stored as a Sparse Voxel DAG.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
  		The paper presents and efficient technique for reducing the size of SVO by merging common subtrees and transforming to a DAG.
    }
    \item{
    	This can dramatically reduce memory demands in real world scenes and scales even better with increased resolutions.
    }
    \item{
    	This is based on assumption that the original DAG contains a large amount of redundant subtrees
    }
    \item{
    	This paper implements and evaluates algorithms for calculating hard and soft shadows and ambitent occlusion by Ray tracing in DAG 
    }

	\begin{enumerate}[a.]
		\item{The original tree.}
		\item{Non-unique leaves are reduced.}
		\item{Now, there are non-unique nodes in the level above the leaves. These are reduced, creating non-unique nodes in the level above this.}
		\item{The process proceeds until we obtain our final directed acyclic graph.}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Terminology}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{
		Consider an $N^3$ voxel grid as a scene representation where each cell can be represented by a bit : \textbf{0} if empty and \textbf{1} if it contains geometry
		}
		\item{
			A sparse voxel octree recursivley divided $L$ time gives us a hierarchical representation of and $N^3$ voxel grid, where $N = 2^L$ and L is called as \textit{max level}.
		}
		\item{
			The sparse represnetation is achieved is achieved by culling away nodes that corresponds to empty space
		}
		\item{
			A node is implemented with a \textit{childmask}, a bitmask of 8 bits where bit $i$ tells us if bit $i$  contains a geometry, and a pointer to first of non-empty children.
		}
		\item{
			Child nodes are stored consecutively in memory	
		}
		\item{
			The unique traversal \textit{path}, from root to a specific node in SVO, defines the voxel without storing spatial information explicitly in the node 
		}
