	\begin{frame}{Abstract}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {
		A binary voxel grid can be represented more efficiently by using a Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG) than Sparse Voxel Octree(SVO)
		}
		\item {
			Along with efficient encoding of empty regions , DAG allows efficient encoding of identical regions as nodes are allowed to share pointers
		}
		\item {
			This paper presents a bottom-up algorithm to reduce a SVO to DAG
		}
		\item {
			The memory consumption of DAG is significantly smaller and it would fit in memory where SVO won't
		}
		\item {
			DAG requires no decompression and can be traversed easily
		}
		\item {
			This paper demonstrates this by ray tracing hard and soft shadows , ambient occlusion , and primary rays in extremly high resolution DAG at speed at par or even faster than voxel and triangle GPU ray tracing.

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    There is increased interest in evaluating secondary rays for effects as reflection, shadows and indirect illumination. Due to the incoherence, a scondary scene representation is required with strict memory budget
    
  }
  \item {   
    This acceleration structure has to be resident on RAM for effiecient access.
  }
  \item{
  However this is problematic when triangle meshes are augmented with displacement maps as they become infeasibly large to millions of polygons
  }
  \item {
  	Recently Sparse Voxel Octree(SVO) has been used as a secondary scene representation, since they can be efficiently ray traced in real time.
  }
  \item {
  	At high resolution, SVO is still too much memory expensive, therefore it's application has been limited }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
  		The data structure \textbf{DAG} allows for extremly high resolution enabling us to improve image quality, decrease discretization artifacts, explore high frequency effects like sharp shadows in large scenes.
    }
 
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
  		The paper presents and efficient technique for reducing the size of SVO by merging common subtrees and transforming to a DAG.
    }
    \item{
    	This can dramatically reduce memory demands in real world scenes and scales even better with increased resolutions.
    }
    \item{
    	This is based on assumption that the original DAG contains a large amount of redundant subtrees
    }
    \item{
    	This paper implements and evaluates algorithms for calculating hard and soft shadows and ambitent occlusion by Ray tracing in DAG 
    }

\section{Reducing a Sparse Voxel Tree to a DAG}
\begin{frame}{Reducing a Sparse Voxel Tree to a DAG}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{fig2}{ Figure 2:Reducing a sparse voxel tree, illustrated using a binary tree, instead of an octree, for clarity.}
	\begin{enumerate}[a.]
		\item{The original tree.}
		\item{Non-unique leaves are reduced.}
		\item{Now, there are non-unique nodes in the level above the leaves. These are reduced, creating non-unique nodes in the level above this.}
		\item{The process proceeds until we obtain our final directed acyclic graph.}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Terminology}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{
		Consider an $N^3$ voxel grid as a scene representation where each cell can be represented by a bit : \textbf{0} if empty and \textbf{1} if it contains geometry
		}
		\item{
			A sparse voxel octree recursivley divided $L$ time gives us a hierarchical representation of and $N^3$ voxel grid, where $N = 2^L$ and L is called as \textit{max level}.
		}
		\item{
			A node is implemented with a \textit{childmask}, a bitmask of 8 bits where bit $i$ tells us if bit $i$  contains a geometry, and a pointer to first of non-empty children.
		}
		\item{
			Child nodes are stored consecutively in memory	
		}
		\item{
			The unique traversal \textit{path}, from root to a specific node in SVO, defines the voxel without storing spatial information explicitly in the node 
		}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The sparse voxel DAG}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{
		To Transform an SVO to a DAG we will use a bottom up approach.
		}
		\item{
		The leaf nodes are defined by uniquely by childmask of 8-bit, so there can be atmost $2^8=256$ unique leaf nodes}
		\item{
		Steps of Reduction:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item{Merge identical leaves with same bitmask}
				\item{Proceed to level above and mege nodes with \textit{Identical childmask} and \textit{Identical pointers}}
				\item{Iteratively perform this step by merging larger and larger subtrees}
			\end{enumerate}
		}
		\item{The smallest possible DAG is guranteed to be found in L iterations}
		\item{
		This is also applicable for non-uniform octrees and partially reduced DAG's
		}
		\item{
		This allows us to conveniently build DAGs from	SVOs too large to reside in RAM or on disk.
		}
		
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Implementation Details - DAG Construction}
\begin{itemize}
\item{While building a dag of level $L>10$ we first construct top L-10 levels by triangle/cube intersection in a top down fashion}
\item{For each leaf we construct the subtree till mazimum depth}
\item{The subtree is reduced to DAG and then we proceed to next leaf}
\item{After all sub-DAG's get have been constructed, we have top-level SVO with many DAG}
\item{We apply reduction one last time to produce one final DAG}
\item{The result is same as if we processed complete SVO but the memory consumption while construction is considerably low}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Implementation Details - Merging Nodes}
\begin{itemize}
\item{We sort the nodes of a level using a \textit{256-bit} $($8 child * 32-bit pointer$)$ key and pointer as value}
\item{Identical nodes become adjacent and can be compacted to a single nodes}
\item{We also maintain a table of inderection, for each node we know the pointer to compacted node}
\item{To imporve performance we store subtrees of resolution $4^3$ of last two rows into a 64-bit integer}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Ray Tracing a Sparse Voxel DAG}

\begin{frame}{Ray Tracing a Sparse Voxel DAG}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item{The paper implements a GPU-based Raytracer in CUDA that efficiently traverses the scene representation}
	\item{The raytracer is primarily used for visibility queries to evaluate hard shadows, soft shadows, and ambient occlusion
	}
	\item{Ambient occlusion is usually approximated by casting a number
of rays over the hemisphere and averaging the occlusion of each
ray}
